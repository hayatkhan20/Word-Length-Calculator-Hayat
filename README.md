# Word-Length-Calculator-Hayat

# Description:

The Word Length Calculator is a simple web application designed to calculate and display the length of a word entered by the user. Upon opening the application in a web browser, users are greeted with a clean and user-friendly interface. They are prompted to input a word into the provided text field and can then click the "Calculate Length" button. Upon clicking the button, the application uses JavaScript and DOM manipulation to retrieve the entered word, calculates its length using the `length` method, and dynamically updates the displayed result. The result is presented in a clear and easy-to-read format, informing the user of the length of the entered word.

The development of this application involves a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML file provides the structure of the web page, including the input field, button, and result display area. The CSS file adds styling to enhance the visual appeal of the application, using fonts, colors, and spacing. The core functionality is implemented using JavaScript. The `calculateWordLength` function is triggered by an event listener attached to the "Calculate Length" button. This function retrieves the inputted word, calculates its length, and updates the result displayed on the page. While no formal pseudocode is provided in the comments, the JavaScript code can be considered a form of pseudocode as it outlines the step-by-step logic for the application's functionality. The use of clear variable names and comments further enhances the code's readability and understanding.
